Datacamp project: Analysing NYC public test scores in SQL.

Hello! This was a short project I did in Datacamp's workspace using some SQL queries.
Querying this database in SQL to analyse and decide which are the best and worst schools in the NYC area according to the scores their students got in maths, writing and reading.

Enjoy!
